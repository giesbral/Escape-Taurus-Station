LOOK_AT
This mountain of dishes, like all mountains, started small but grew over time 
with steady, tectonic persistence. You can see a colony of the tiny black
arthropods that pass for space cockroaches quietly blinking at you from among
the filthy plates, cups, bowls, silverware, pots, pans, kitchen gadgets, 
and serving trays. You imagine this probably constitutes some sort of 
health hazard, and you should probably do something. But then again, you've 
got a lot on your plate right now, and you're willing to bet someone else 
will take care of it if you wait long enough.
