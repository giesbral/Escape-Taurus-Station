LOOK_AT
A silver fountain pen that smells faintly of cleaning alcohol. The phrase,
"For Our Fearless Leader" is etched into the side.
END

USE
You wave the around pen like a sword, decorating the bulkhead and deck with
spatters of ink. Other than making a bit of a mess, this behavior doesn't
appear to be particularly effective.
END

USE***PAPER
You put pen to paper. All is still for a moment. Another moment. A black blot 
spreads slowly from the tip of your pen. Finally, you decide to write
something encouraging to yourself. You print, "Be your best self today!" at 
the top of the page. You reflect that there were probably better uses for this 
paper, but fold it and put it back in your pocket anyway.
END

USE***ACTIVATED
You feel okay with what you've written so far, and wouldn't want to crowd the 
page with extraneous details. You decide to leave the paper alone for now.
