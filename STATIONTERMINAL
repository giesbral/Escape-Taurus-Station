USE
You approach a gently beeping wall terminal. It’s identical to the many others 
installed throughout the ship, though this one has a flash of long spidery 
cracks running across the screen. Used for ship-wide communications, crew logs, 
and playing the occasional game of off-duty mahjong. You try a series of 
commands to see if you can contact anyone else on the ship, but the screen 
continues to read,
“CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY. 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURE ‘TERESHKOVA’ CURRENTLY IN EFFECT. 
ALL OFFICERS REPORT TO DUTY STATIONS IMMEDIATELY.”
