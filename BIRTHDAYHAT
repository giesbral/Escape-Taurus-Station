LOOK_AT
This hat looks like it was made from old cereal boxes and broken computer 
components. It very much resembles a little crown. Grey computer keys have been 
glued to the front to spell, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HAL". 
END

TAKE
You pick up the birthday hat. It looks like a crown and is suprisingly heavy. 
You add it to your pockets.
END

WEAR
You gingerly fit the crown around your temples. You feel like the birthday king. 
You quickly take it off again before the power goes to your head.
