LOOK_AT
You see the controls for the laser array used to send messages across space
at light speed. The console seems dead, but you press several keys in a
hopeful attempt to reboot the system. Several of the status lights sputter 
optimistically before the system dies completely. Grey smoke starts to ooze 
from the back of the console. You are overcome with dismay for a quick moment
before laughing to yourself, remembering the the laser emitter was attached
to the bulkhead beneath the floor of the comms center. Seeing that the floor
of the comms center is now a giant crater, it's doubtful that you would've 
been able to send a distress signal anyway.
