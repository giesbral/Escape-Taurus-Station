DESCRIPTION
To the fore, you see stout security doors marked “CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - JIN WEI 
LING”. The power seems to be off in this section of the ship and one of the 
doors is jammed at a broken angle. You can just fit in the gap left between 
them. The room beyond is black as ink; you feel a nervous twinge in your neck 
at the thought of stumbling around in there without a light.
