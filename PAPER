LOOK_AT
This is a sheet of creamy white paper, that appears to be made from real wood.
You didn't realize the captain went in for such opulence, but then you guess 
it was probably for the hand-written letters the captain sometimes sent home. 
The paper has taken on the spicy scents of orange and cinnamon. You wonder 
at how long the captain had it hidden in his desk.

LOOK_AT***ACTIVATED
This is a sheet of creamy white paper on which you've written the short note,
"Be your best self today!" You begin to imagine the alternate universes 
containing the you's that were varying degrees of not their best selves today. 
You blink slowly and remark that you have the beginnings of a bad headache.
END

USE
You vigorously shake the sheet of paper. The paper expresses some mild 
discomfort at your man-handling, but otherwise nothing happens.
END

USE***PEN
You put pen to paper. All is still for a moment. Another moment. A black blot 
spreads slowly from the tip of your pen. Finally, you decide to write
something encouraging to yourself. You print, "Be your best self today!" at 
the top of the page. You reflect that there were probably better uses for this 
paper, but fold it and put it back in your pocket anyway.
END

USE***ACTIVATED
You feel okay with what you've written so far, and wouldn't want to crowd the 
page with extraneous details. You decide to leave the paper alone for now.
