LOOK_AT
You examine one of the bodies. It's been torn apart in such a horrific fashion
that you find it impossible to identify, but you see the blue insignia of the
engineering division above a blood spattered name tag. You tentatively reach 
down to rub some of the crusted blood away with your thumb. The name tag says
that this was the chief engineer, Sevda. Everyone called her Sev.
You used to come here with her sometimes. As the Earth turned slowly above 
you, she would tell you about her life back home in Turkey, her cat 
Philosopher, her little brother Ata. You stare at the name tag for several 
long minutes as a numb, dead hollow slowly fills your chest.
You need to get out of here.

SEARCH
You see a dull metal something protruding from one of the chief engineer's
front pockets. It's attached to a bit of black string, which you snatch at
quickly, trying not to disturb the body. A quiet ringing echoes through the 
solarium as you pull it free. It's a small, simple key that's been labeled 
with a bit of masking tape. The label reads, "CRANE".
You put it in your pocket.

There's nothing else here. You leave the body alone for now.
