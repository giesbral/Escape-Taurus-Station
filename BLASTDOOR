LOOK_AT***ACTIVATED
The emergency blast doors to the ship’s bridge have retracted into the wall. 
You could now wander the bridge at your leisure.
END

LOOK_AT
You see a heavy blast door blocking your way to the bridge. 
In the middle of the door, there's a small computer screen 
displaying the message,

 SECURITY LOCKDOWN: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY
 EMERGENCY PROCEDURE ‘TERESHKOVA’ CURRENTLY IN EFFECT
 OVERRIDE LEVEL: SALAMANDER; COMMANDER LEVEL OVERRIDE REQUIRED
 PLEASE PRESENT CREDENTIALS

Next to the screen, there's a small circular hole outlined in a dull neon red.
If it's a keyhole, the key that it fits is certainly complex. You'll have to
find whatever "CREDENTIALS" the computer is referring to if you want to open
the door.
END

USE***CAPTAINSKEY
You insert the Captain's key into a circular slot in the blast door. A bright
"Bing!" issues from the center computer panel as the doors whoosh open.
A brisk male voice, toned halfway between an announcement and a greeting, says
"WELCOME. CAPTAIN LING."
END

USE***ACTIVATED
The blast doors are open and only close in an emergency. If you want to close
them again, you'll have to put a hole in the hull or install a hostile A.I. 
onto the ship's computers. 
Neither of these activities seem like a fair trade for the privilege of being 
locked out of the bridge again, so you leave the doors alone for now.
END

USE
The blast doors are firmly closed. Blowing them open and destroying half
the bridge seems like a bad idea and there doesn't seem to be a way to open
them other than finding the right key. You leave them alone for now.
