DESCRIPTION
Portside, the small door is ajar and you can see a narrow passage 
to the solarium. The passage makes a sharp turn before it terminates, so
you can't see into the solarium from here, but like the Captain's Quarters,
it looks like it must be exceptionally dark in there. 
You guess that the power must be off on this side of the station.
