LOOK_AT
This is a handheld, high-gain plasma cutter. The engineering team would use it
to cut through steel bulkheads and armor plate. It has a plasma beam emitter 
that attaches to a battery with a piece of thick rubber hose. For convenience,
the battery has a loop that attaches to your belt. The battery weighs about 25 
pounds though, so it appears that this feature is only convenient for pulling
down your pants while you're waving a plasma cutter around.

IGNITE
You've successfully ignited your plasma cutter. You stare at the beam for a 
few minutes, mesmerized by the glowing violet blade. You quickly remember that 
this beam can cut through your arms, hands, and face as easily as it cuts
through armor plate, so you turn it off for now.

USE***COLLAPSEDPASSAGE
You ignite the plasma cutter and spend several minutes clearing the debris
from the passageway. When you're done, there's a pile of slightly melted steel
in the corridor behind you, and the way to the Medical Bay is clear.
