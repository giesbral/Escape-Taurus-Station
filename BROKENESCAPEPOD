LOOK_AT
It's an escape pod... the only way off this ship. Unfortunately, it's busted 
up pretty bad and several parts are in desperate need of replacement.
END

LOOK_AT***READY
All the broken parts are replaced and the pod is ready to use.
END

USE
This pod isn't going anywhere until the broken parts can be replaced.

USE***READY
Now that you finally have a working escape pod, you climb inside and strap 
yourself into the nearest crash seat. The escape pod twisted in its firing
cylinder, presumably when it was damaged, so that once you're strapped in,
you're awkwardly hanging from the ceiling against the restraints. You reach 
over to the pod's console and enter the commands to begin the launch sequence. 
A countdown issues from the intercom as the pod doors slam closed with a loud 
"SPANG!" You brace yourself as the countdown reaches zero and the locking pins 
fire. A loud roar beats the air from your lungs and flings the escape pod away 
from the station at harrowing speed. As the pod accelerates your vision 
darkens and you feel yourself swallowed in the padding of your crash seat. 
Several long seconds pass before the force of the booster rockets fades.
You begin to float away from your seat; the escape pod isn't large enough
to support artificial gravity. You take a deep breath and unbuckle yourself, 
heading to the console to check the pod's trajectory. You flip through the 
external camera feeds until you spot the Earth, still a blue dime at this 
distance, but you nearly cry in relief, you're finally going home! 
You feel a numb, distant pang in your chest as your mind drifts to the broken
station and your dead friends. You wish you had more answers, an explanation 
for their loss. You make an angry vow to get to the bottom of things when you
get to Earth. For now, however, you're overcome with exhaustion. 
You strap yourself back into your crash seat. Your eyes close and you quickly
succumb to sleep, and dreams of home.

You strap yourself back into your crash seat. Your eyes close and you quickly
succumb to sleep, and dreams of home....

You startle awake with a gasp and search with trembling hands to find 
yourself still strapped into the crash seat of your escape pod. 
You're covered in cold sweat and your tongue feels like a lump of sand in your
mouth. The escape pod is dark, lit only by the dim glow of the pod's computer 
monitor. A faint echo reverberates through the air and makes you wonder if 
you were screaming in your sleep. You jump and remember the thought that 
brought you so suddenly to wakefulness: the security footage! You forgot you 
brought the tape with you! You launch yourself over to the console and examine
the machine, frantically hoping that the thing was installed with a data tape
reader. You cry out as you find the peripheral hidden under a nearby panel. 
You pull the tape from your pocket and stuff it into the machine. 
Your nose almost touches the screen as you punch the play button. 

The footage is just static for a few terrible seconds before clearing to a 
wide shot of the communications center. There are several crew members in 
view, all working diligently at their stations. It takes you a few
moments to realize that one of the crew members is you. You're just at the 
edge of the screen, on the left, working at the decoding console. 
The scene continues for a few silent seconds as anxiety slowly swells in
your stomach. Abruptly, a series of bright flashes emanate from 
the decoding console, momentarily turning the video footage blinding white. 
When the picture refocuses, you see your crewmates struggling to keep you from
hurting yourself as you writhe on the floor, your back arched and arms
banging against the hull like an overturned beetle. You watch dark, inky 
shadow ooze from your eyes and mouth, slowly engulfing your body. 
You see your body suddenly jerked to full height as you toss your crewmates
against the bulkheads like rag dolls. Their bodies crunch and bounce to 
the floor. Black, greedy flames engulfs your body. You watch your form blur 
and flash like a mirage, splitting into multiple refracted images.
Quivering jet flames spread from your body to the floor, to the walls of the 
comm center, to the bodies of your friends. You watch your frothing black form 
raise its arms in a silent roar. An explosion flashes from the right, 
shaking the video feed a second before it cuts abruptly to gray static. 

Your screen transitions to a glossy white screen saver. 
You hear the player begin to rewind the tape. You look down. You gape in 
horror at your outstretched hands; the player's whirring thrum begins to roar
in your ears. Your hands appear bone white in the light. You can't catch your
breath; it sticks in your throat as your mind fills with images of 
stormy black glass. Dark wildfire creeps into the edges of your vision as you
watch your hands snap and burst into a thousand vibrating afterimages...
