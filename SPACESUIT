LOOK_AT
It's a standard spacesuit, issued to all Taurus Station personnel.
This one is orange with white straps and helmet, with a thin, 
square backpack containing the life support systems and propulsion jets for 
navigating in zero-g vacuum.
It's built to fit over your jumpsuit, and is surprisingly light.
END

TAKE
You lift the spacesuit from the locker and sling it over your shoulder, like
you're kidnapping a weird, orange, skin person. It's not heavy, but the helmet
bangs against your legs while you walk. You think that it would probably be 
better to just wear the thing.
END

USE
You lift the spacesuit from the locker and begin undoing the multitude of
clips and zippers. Several minutes later you're wearing a spacesuit, like a
real astronaut. Though this one appears to have belonged to someone else, 
it's a little too tight in the legs and the gloves are a bit too big. 
Otherwise, it's surprisingly comfortable. Something about its snug embrace 
makes you feel safe.
END

USE***ACTIVATED
The spacesuit is so comfortable, and the station in such a questionable
state of repair, that you never want to take it off. You flex your fingers in
the gloves, and smile to yourself at the rubbery squeaks this produces.

WEAR***ACTIVATED
You're already wearing the spacesuit. Taking the spacesuit off and putting it
back on again would be silly, and you keep getting caught in the zippers.
