LOOK_AT
This bright red key belonged to the station's captain and looks like a
hollow, knobby cylinder. Looking down the barrel of it you can see an 
intricate, shallow labyrinth covering the inside of the tube. 
A little blue light is set in the handle, and it chirps at you occasionally.
This key should be all the clearance you need to get into the bridge.

USE***BLASTDOOR
You insert the Captain's key into a circular slot in the blast door and a 
bright "Bing!" issues from the center computer panel as the doors whoosh open.
A brisk male voice, toned halfway between an announcement and a greeting, says
"WELCOME. CAPTAIN LING."
