LOOK_AT
This broad hardwood desk is the property of Captain Jin Wei Ling. You 
remember him saying it was a gift from his father. He either loves it,
or feels some obligation to it, as he's kept it polished to a high gloss;
the wood grain makes squiggly paths across the surface, like streams
in the mountains. It has an excellent collection of little drawers and 
its fragrant hardwoods fill the room with a subtle spice.
Above the desk there's a picture of the captain and his family standing in 
front of the Academy building in New Sao Paulo.

SEARCH
Imagining you might find something useful, you (somewhat gleefully) pull open 
all the little drawers. You uncover the following treasures: 
a fancy fountain pen, a sheet of real wood-pulp paper, a charging 
device for a pocket computer, and the Captain's station key. 
You add them all to your pockets.

SEARCH***ACTIVATED
You pull open all the little drawers again and giggle softly to yourself. 
While you could probably do this forever, the activity doesn't reveal any 
additional items that might be useful.
