LOOK_AT
This appears to be a piece of fabric torn from a station jumpsuit. 
Someone has used a black marker to cover it with frantic, spidery print. 
It was pinned to the bulkhead with a supermagnet pulled from a data drive, 
which strikes you as a bit odd.
END

READ
The note reads:

"We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the bridge 
and the comms. We still hold the Crew Quarters but hope is fading now - 
we cannot get out. 
The end comes soon. We hear screams, screams in the deep...
They are coming...."

This seems a bit dramatic to you. If these were really the author's last
moments, you would think it would be a better use of their remaining time
to write down some useful information instead of some cryptic note. You
leave the note where it is.
END

TAKE
The supermagnet pinning the note to the wall remains steadfast, despite
several minutes of prying. You imagine it mocking you, which is a cynical 
thing to attribute to a inanimate supermagnet. It also looks like the note is 
staying where it is.
