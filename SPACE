LOOK_AT
You can see bits of splintered bulkhead fluttering in the moonlight as
you scan the gaping hole in the deck. The bright sliver of the moon overwhelms
the stars and space appears flat and black. You pull yourself away from 
the edge as you're gripped by the morbid temptation to tip yourself 
into the void.
