LOOK_AT
This is a heavy-duty security flashlight that...no, hold on, there’s no 
batteries in this thing. Correction: You have a fancy metal stick with a 
clicky button. Clicking the button produces disappointment.
END

LOOK_AT***READY
A heavy-duty security flashlight. Paint’s a bit chipped but the batteries are 
still good. You find the brisk “kuh-click!” it makes when you turn it on and 
off quite satisfying. Should be useful for lighting up any malls, museums, 
amusement parks, or haunted starships you happen to come across.
END

USE
“Kuh-click!” Nothing happens. Your flashlight remains aloof and despondent. 
It demands a sacrifice of fresh batteries.
END

USE***BATTERY
You insert the battery into your fancy metal stick. With the addition of this 
fuel source, you have transformed your near useless fancy metal stick into a 
handheld, directed photon cannon, often colloquially referred to as a 
"flashlight".
END

COMBINE***BATTERY
You insert the battery into your fancy metal stick. With the addition of this 
fuel source, you have transformed your near useless fancy metal stick into a 
handheld, directed photon cannon, often colloquially referred to as a 
"flashlight".
END

COMBINE***READY
Your flashlight is working, so you think better of trying to fix what isn't 
broken and leave the flashlight as it is.
END

USE***READY
“Kuh-click!” Photons are now pouring from the end of your photon gun and are 
splashing about the room at ludicrous speeds. Several loose photons catch you 
unawares and shoot right into your retinas. You find this causes your brain to 
produce occasionally useful pictures of things in your immediate vicinity. 
You think quietly to yourself about the magic of science. 
(Your flashlight is now emitting light.)
END

USE***READY***ACTIVATED
“Kuh-click!” Your flashlight is no longer wantonly flinging photons around the 
room. (Your flashlight is off.)
