LOOK_AT
It’s a steel ring bearing several square, fiddly-looking keys. It was looted 
unceremoniously from the Security Chief’s dead body. By you. You monster.

USE***ARMORYDOOR
You try several of the fiddly keys on the keyring. Finally, one especially
fiddly key clicks in the lock. You hear the humming of hydraulics as the 
seals crack on the armored doors. They open slightly with a sudden jolt 
and then slide apart with a smooth motion. As cool air floods the room, your
nose fills with the tangy odors of oil and gunmetal. However, you see nothing,
the lights appear to be off in the armory.
