Doc ran the Med Bay like a drill sargeant. It was always so aseptic and clean 
you could see yourself in so many shiny surfaces. The Med Bay on this station 
was particularly advanced. It could handle everything from your everyday 
sprains to broken bones and even cosmic radiation poisoning. Yeah, everyone 
liked Doc.
