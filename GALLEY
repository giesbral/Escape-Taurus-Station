LONGFORM
You're in the ship's galley, which is dark and lit only by the fuzzy red glow 
of a neon sign above the corridor to the hydroponics lab. It's main space is 
filled with several long aluminum tables and space-age yellow chairs. You see 
hundreds of small, meticulously-labeled metal cupboards cover the walls from 
floor to ceiling. The room looks like it's been decorated for a birthday party.
Plates, cups, and a large, white cake cover the middle table. You're the only 
one here; it looks like whatever crisis the station suffered forced the party's
hasty abandonment. As you look around, you notice that all the cupboards along 
the aft bulkhead have blown open; their contents of prepackaged food and 
cafeteria miscellany spill onto the floor. Huddled against the starboard wall, 
a small kitchen appears to be one nasty knife away from being permanently 
overtaken by a mountain of dirty dishes.

SHORTFORM
This is the ship’s galley. It has the look of a cafeteria that was hastily 
abandoned in the middle of an adult’s birthday party two weeks ago. Which is a 
look too specific to be familiar to many people, but it’s oddly familiar to you.
