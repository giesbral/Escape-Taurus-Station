LOOK_AT
This pack of C4 would pack a mighty punch! It could come in handy later.
END

TAKE
You pick up the pack of C4. You might IGNITE it later.

IGNITE
You don't want to blow up just any random part of the ship. You want to blow
up a very specific part of the ship. There's only so much C4 to go around. You
leave the C4 alone for now.

USE***SECURITYGATE
You press the some of your C4 against the center of the security gate and pull
the pin to ignite the fuse. You quickly run very far away, crouch behind a big
metal locker, and put your fingers in your ears like a cartoon villain 
destroying a railway. A few seconds later, a large explosion rips through the
Engineering Bay, flinging bits of smoking metal just past your head. As the 
tremors subside, you peer over the locker to admire your handiwork. 
You've managed to put a large hole in the center of the security gate, its
edges still glowing with heat. You're pleasantly surprised at how well that
went.
