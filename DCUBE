LOOK_AT
Dilithium is an extremely complex and hard crystalline structure 
(2(5)6 dilithlum 2(:)l diallosilicate 1:9:1 heptoferranide), which occurs 
naturally on some planets. When placed in a high-frequency electromagnetic 
field, magnetic eddies are induced in its structure which keep charged 
particles away from the crystal lattice. This prevents it from reacting with 
antimatter when so energized, because the antimatter atoms never actually 
touch it. Therefore, it is used to contain and regulate the annihilation 
reaction of matter and antimatter in a starship's warp core, which otherwise 
would explode from the uncontrolled annihilation reaction. Though low-quality 
artificial crystals can be grown or replicated, they are limited in the power 
of the reaction they can regulate without fragmenting, and are therefore 
largely unsuitable for warp drive applications. Due to the need for natural 
dilithium crystals for interstellar travel, deposits of this material are a 
highly contested resource, and as such dilithium crystals have led to more 
interstellar conflict than all other reasons combined.
