LONGFORM
The station's armory is top notch. Row upon row of rifles of every 
make and caliber. Every repair, every modification you could imagine could be 
completed in this room. The normally well ordered space looks to be in 
complete  disarray. You see coil guns and gauss rifles lying on the floor 
next to bricks of C4. Jesus....someone needs to clean this shit up.
END

SHORTFORM
You are located in the Armory.
END

DARK
You're inside the station's armory. It's very dark and you can't see anything. 
It smells like oily gunpowder in here. In your head, a small, insistent voice
urges you to watch your step.
