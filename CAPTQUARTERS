LONGFORM
Jin Wei Ling was a meticulous captain and his quarters reflects his 
devotion to order. Nothing is out of place. A large hardwood desk fills a
corner of the room. Pinned to the wall, there is a scrawled note.

SHORTFORM
You are located in the Captain's Quarters.

DARK
It's oppressively dark in here. You hold on to the small reassurance granted
by the gaggle of cheery yellow lights from the station monitors. As you wait
in the dark, you imagine them slowly blinking out, one by one. 
Each a small, lonely death, consumed by an unknown beast in the black. 

You quickly shake the thoughts away. 
Good gravy, your imagination has been a real downer lately.
