LOOK_AT
This cargo crane looks more like a robotic arm than a piece of construction
equipment. It's long lifting boom has at least three ball joints and is 
painted bright orange. Presumably so it's easier to see when it's swinging 
towards your head. It's attached to a guide rail in the floor and looks like 
it could reach anywhere in the engineering bay. However, it doesn't have any 
power at the moment, so it's not going to reach anything until you can find a 
way to turn it on. There's a little slot for a key in the control panel at 
its base, which your finely honed mind tells you must be a clue.

LOOK_AT***READY
This cargo crane looks more like a robotic arm than a piece of construction
equipment. It's long lifting boom has at least three ball joints and is 
painted bright orange. Presumably so it's easier to see when it's swinging 
towards your head. It's attached to a guide rail in the floor and looks like 
it could reach anywhere in the engineering bay. It's currently powered and
humming contentedly.
END

USE
You fiddle with the crane's controls, but nothing happens. You feel slightly
disappointed, and make a note to lower your expectations before trying that
again. 
END

USE***CRANEKEY
The key requires some forceful encouragement, but finally clicks into the lock
on the crane's control panel. You turn the key and the crane begins to hum 
contentedly as several status lights blink on. Everything appears to be in 
working order, and you can now crane around the engineering bay as much as 
you'd like.
END

USE***READY
You use the controls to swing the crane arm around. It thrashes about like a
giant snake dying in a swimming pool and you imagine the possibilities if you
covered the crane arm with a giant puppet. At the same time, you recognize
that this isn't doing very much to further your goals. Maybe you could try 
using the crane with those storage shelves...
END

USE***READY***STORAGESHELVES
As you move the cargo crane towards the storage shelves, the crane arm 
suddenly springs to life. It appears to be executing a pre-programmed mission 
to rearrange the shelves' contents. The arm is moving at a blinding speed; you
can see little more than a red blur as the machine feverishly organizes. 
Several minutes later, everything on the shelves appears to be ... reverse 
alphabetized? You're not sure what purpose that would serve, but many 
components that were out of reach before are now at your fingertips.
END

USE***READY***ACTIVATED
You fiddle with the crane's controls, but the crane appears to be in some sort
of cooldown mode after it's bout of frenzied organizing. You leave it alone
for now.
