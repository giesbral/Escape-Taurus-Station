LONGFORM
You are in the communications center. You remember that you used to work here,
though these memories are strangely hazy. You dimly recall that you were 
responsible for security and translation of communications from deep space. 
However, the comm center you are in now is almost unrecognizable to you. 
The deck is gone, wrenched free by a wild explosion. Past the ragged edge of 
the bulkhead you can see the unrelenting void of space. Just peeking over the
shattered steel and frayed insulation, a sliver of the white moon. 
A riot of debris languidly twirling through the airless room sparkles and 
flashes in the moonlight. A sudden chill crawls through your bones, despite 
the warm cocoon of your space suit.

Across the breach, you can see what remains of the communications computers. 
The cold orange glimmer of several status lights tells you that at least
some of the equipment is still functional.

SHORTFORM
You are located in the Communications Center. An explosion has removed the
floor and all the air in the room. Some of the communications equipment
is still functional.
