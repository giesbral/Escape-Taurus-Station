LONGFORM
The escape pod room is the one room no crew member ever wanted to have to 
enter. You notice that the remaining escape pods all appear to be busted. 
Damn. But upon closer inspection...a few look to be in repairable condition. 
If you can repair one, you can get back to the surface and survive!
