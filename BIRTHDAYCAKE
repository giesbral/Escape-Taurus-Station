LOOK_AT
Small, multicolored pools of wax are melted into the top of this cake. They
partially obscure the message, "Happy Birthday Hal!" written blue icing.
The stale air has hardened the frosting into an impenetrable, white crust. 
It looks otherwise untouched, which more than anything else you've seen so far 
fills you with cold dread: what horrible crisis would force the crew to 
abandon a perfectly good cake? 

As you turn away, your hands begin to tremble nervously.
