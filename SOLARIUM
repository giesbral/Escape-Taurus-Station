LONGFORM
You're now in the Solarium. A large, round cupola window fills the ceiling. 
You used to love this room, and would spend many a free evening lying on the 
floor with your friends, looking out across the stars and the blue ball 
of the Earth. 
Now, this is just a haunted rotunda where you find several bodies of your 
former crewmates slumped against the walls in violent configurations. 
The air purifiers are having trouble overcoming the smell; 
you fight the urge to be sick as the scent of old gore fills your nostrils. 
END

SHORTFORM
You are located in the Solarium. The mangled bodies of several of your 
crewmates lie slumped against the walls.
END

DARK
It's very dark here and it smells terrible. You can't see anything other than
a few stars winking through the giant cupola window overhead.
