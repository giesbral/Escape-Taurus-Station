The storage shelves are now neatly arranged, their contents organized into
reverse-alphabetical order by an industrious robotic crane. There doesn't
seem to be anything you can use among the tools and mechanical detritus.
END

LOOK_AT***READY
The storage shelves are now neatly arranged, their contents organized into
reverse-alphabetical order by an industrious robotic crane. Several components
that were out of reach are now within your grasp, if only you had the will to
reach out and take them.
END

LOOK_AT
These storage shelves are crowded with tools, spare parts, old physics 
experiments, broken lab equipment, computer components, and an inexplicable 
number of damaged microwaves. You think you see a fusion generator for
an escape pod hiding on one of the top shelves, but you have no way to reach
it from here. 
END

SEARCH***READY
Thanks to your new friend, the cargo crane, you reach out and pluck a fusion
generator for the escape pod from the bottom shelf and add it to your growing
collection of pilfered knickknacks.
END

SEARCH***ACTIVATED
The shelves are crowded, but with things you can't use right now. You leave
them alone.
END

SEARCH
You look for a way up to the pod part you need, but the shelves are spaced
too far apart for a normal human to climb. You could head to the research lab 
and make some quick adjustments to your genetic code, lengthening your arms
and spine until you could climb the shelves at ease, but with the unfortunate
side effect of causing men to scream in terror and women to faint at the mere
sight of your grotesque, misshapen form. Alternatively, you could maybe find a
ladder or something.
