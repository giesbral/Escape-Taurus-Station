DESCRIPTION
You can see down a long corridor to the security office. The 
fluorescent ceiling lights manage to give the corridor the appearance of a 
condemned government archives building. You can just see gloomy beams from the 
shipâ€™s yellow emergency lamps lighting bits of the security office, which seems 
strangely dark, now that you think about it.
