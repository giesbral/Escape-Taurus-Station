LOOK_AT
This is a control panel for the airlock. There's a big warning sign hanging 
above it displaying a gruesomely detailed diagram of an astronaut's head
exploding because he took his space helmet off. You consider yourself warned.
END

USE
You remember from your astronaut training that you need a spacesuit when 
you're in space, or space is very bad for you. You nod to yourself sagely
and decide to leave the controls alone until you have the proper equipment.
END

USE***READY
The airlock computer acknowledges that you're wearing the proper attire for
a dalliance with space and prepares the airlock for your departure.
