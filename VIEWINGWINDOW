LOOK_AT
This large picture window takes up the entire ceiling of the solarium.
The station's orbit used to be such that the Earth was always visible from
this window. The friendly blue ball is conspicuously absent now, 
leaving a black canvas of coldly glowing stars.

USE
You look up and out the large picture window set in the solarium's ceiling. 
The station's orbit used to be such that the Earth was always 
visible from this window. The friendly blue ball is conspicuously absent now,
leaving a black canvas of coldly glowing stars.
