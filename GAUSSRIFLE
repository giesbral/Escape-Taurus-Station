LOOK_AT
The Gauss Rifle you are looking at is a type of projectile accelerator 
consisting of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of 
a linear motor that accelerates a ferromagnetic or conducting projectile 
to a high velocity. It's pretty straightforward stuff really; you can even buy
small, disposable ones back on Earth for weddings or vacation trips.
END

TAKE
You pick up the Gauss Rifle and place it in your inventory.
END

USE
You decide to save your ammo. Just in case you run into who or whatever
wrecked the station and they're still feeling feisty.
END

USE***COLLAPSEDPASSAGE
You level your Gauss rifle at the blockage and loose a few rounds. You remark
at how cathartic and yet extremely dangerous this is. Minute thumps shake your
eardrums as the projectiles split the air. Small explosions cover you with 
black, melted grit and fragments of bulkhead. When the dust settles, the
debris that blocked the passage is now scattered around the room and the way
to the Medical bay is clear.
