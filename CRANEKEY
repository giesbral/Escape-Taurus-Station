LOOK_AT
It's a small, simple key with a bit of black string looped through the bow.
It's labeled with a bit of masking tape. The label reads, "CRANE".

USE***CARGOCRANE
The key requires some forceful encouragement, but finally clicks into the lock
on the crane's control panel. You turn the key and the crane begins to hum 
contentedly as several status lights blink on. Everything appears to be in 
working order, and you can now crane around the engineering bay as much as 
you'd like.
