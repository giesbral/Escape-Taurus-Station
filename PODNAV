LOOK_AT
This is a large black computer chip in a glass case. 
The label on the back of the case says that, once it's installed in an
escape pod, the pod should be able to find its way home automatically.
It also says that the pod will play soothing jazz music during the trip. 
You think that, perhaps there is a way to turn off this feature. 
The label says no, there's no way to silence the soothing jazz. 
You observe that the chip is a mixed blessing at best.
