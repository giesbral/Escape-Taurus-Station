LOOK_AT***ACTIVATED
You see scattered piles of gently smoking debris and a deformed, but clear, 
passage to the Medical Bay.
END

LOOK_AT
Some explosion or structural accident has destroyed the ceiling in the passage
to the Medical Bay. The ceiling now fully occupies the hallway, which is 
filled with chunks of steel plate, ductwork, copper plumbing, insulation and 
fried electrical wiring. You'd need a big laser or cutting torch if you wanted
to remove the debris.
END

USE***PLASMACUTTER
You ignite the plasma cutter and spend several minutes clearing the debris
from the passageway. When you're done, there's a pile of slightly melted steel
in the corridor behind you, and the way to the Medical Bay is clear.
END

USE***GAUSSRIFLE
You level your Gauss rifle at the blockage and loose a few rounds. You remark
at how cathartic and yet extremely dangerous this is. Minute thumps shake your
eardrums as the projectiles split the air. Small explosions cover you with 
black, melted grit and fragments of bulkhead. When the dust settles, the
debris that blocked the passage is now scattered around the room and the way
to the Medical bay is clear.
END

USE***ACTIVATED
The way is clear, there's nothing more to do here at the moment.
END

USE
The passage is so choked with bulkhead and insulation that there's no way
you're getting through it. You'd need a big laser or cutting torch if you
wanted to remove the debris.
