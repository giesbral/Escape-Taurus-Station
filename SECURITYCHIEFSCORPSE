LOOK_AT
This is the corpse of your former crewmate, Hal. When he was alive he was 
quite a strapping fellow, with broad shoulders and a jaw like the bow of a 
battlecruiser. They say the marine corps made him fight without a shirt 
because of the psychological effects it had on the enemy. Detractors admitted
that the way he handled a laser pistol made Eisenhower look like two kittens 
playing in the laundry. He routinely ate a complete breakfast.

That is to say, you’re sure the someone who put all those gaping holes in his 
torso must be a very dangerous someone.

SEARCH
You deny your better instincts and instead decide to rifle through the pockets 
of your freshly dead crewmate. You attempt a deep breath but your guts 
constrict violently as the smell of warm copper fills your nose and mouth. 
You begin, and quickly your once furtive movements grow frantic as you paw at
the body of your mangled friend. You hear a panicked, mewling sound that can 
only be coming from your own throat. The violet tinge of madness begins to
crowd at the edges of your swiftly spiraling sanity! 

Hal, on the other hand, seems to take the whole procedure rather stoically. 

For your efforts, you are abruptly rewarded with a ring of fiddly looking 
keys, which you put in your pocket.

You’ve thought better of this activity and have decided to give Hal his space 
for now.
