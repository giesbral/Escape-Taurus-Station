LONGFORM
The bridge is unusually cold and quiet. The normally buzzing 
control panels have all fallen silent. The blinking lights of the computer 
terminals are the only thing indicating that something was awake and thinking. 
The machines were constantly thinking. Constantly calculating and recalculating.
Tracking oxygen, CO2, and every other trace gas. Tracking power and fuel. If the
machines ever stop thinking, every living thing on this station will too.
