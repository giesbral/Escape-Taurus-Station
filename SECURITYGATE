LOOK_AT***ACTIVATED
You see an armored security gate with a large smoking hole in it. You could
get into the cargo bay whenever you wanted now.
END

LOOK_AT
You see a large security gate blocking your way to the Cargo Bay. 
The gate is made of thick armor panels that appear to collapse in on each 
other when it opens. There's a control panel to lower the gate, but it looks 
like someone has destroyed it. Without the controls, the gate looks 
impenetrable to anything short of a small bomb.
END

USE***CFOUR
You press the C4 pack against the center of the security gate and pull the pin
to ignite the fuse. You quickly run very far away, crouch behind a big
metal locker, and put your fingers in your ears like a cartoon villain 
destroying a railway. A few seconds later, a large explosion rips through the
Engineering Bay, flinging bits of smoking metal just past your head. As the 
tremors subside, you peer over the locker to admire your handiwork. 
You've managed to put a large hole in the center of the security gate, its
edges still glowing with heat. You're pleasantly surprised at how well that
went.
END

USE***ACTIVATED
The gate already has a large hole in it and you're fresh out of C4.
You leave the gate alone for now.
END

USE
The control panel to lower the security gate appears to have been
intentionally destroyed. There's no way to open the gate now, though you
imagine that a good bomb would probably do it.
