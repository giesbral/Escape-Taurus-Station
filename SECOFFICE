LONGFORM
You’re in the ship’s security office, currently cast in a dim 
yellow by the emergency lamps. You recall that this room is usually trim and 
tidy. Hal was nothing if not fastidious. Now, however, it appears that a gang 
of brigands, or one rather large, energetic brigand, attempted to empty all 
the drawers and cabinets in the room by firing into them with a cannon. 
Papers and shattered equipment lie everywhere in chaotic drifts. 
Some haphazardly aimed device has decorated the bulkheads and consoles with 
black scoring and bright-edged craters. Ductwork spills from the ceiling. 
The sharp odors of melted electronics catch in your nostrils. 
And perhaps another smell, fainter.
It’s musky, primal, and oddly familiar, but you can’t quite place it... 

Despite the wanton destruction, the action doesn’t appear recent. 
Everything iscovered with a fine layer of dust. 
Motes catch in the green light of the few consoles that are still functional.

SHORTFORM
This is the Security Office. It’s been blasted to bits by some violent 
altercation. A few of the consoles are still functional.
