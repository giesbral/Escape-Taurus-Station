You can compile and run the game using g++ on OSU’s FLIP server. We have 
included a makefile for your convenience. To use the makefile simply upload 
the folder containing the source code to FLIP and change the current working 
directory to the 'Engine' folder. After you have entered the 'Engine' folder, 
type ‘make’ (without quotations) into the console and press ‘Enter’ and the 
game should compile. You can then run the game by entering './TaurusStation' 
(without quotations) and then pressing ‘Enter’ into the console.

**Please Note: This game is meant to be played on a console screen 80 
characters wide. You may need to adjust your SSH client (i.e. PuTTY) to 
match these display settings.
