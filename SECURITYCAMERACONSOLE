LOOK_AT
It looks like this console connects to the ship’s security cameras, though its 
eight little screens show nothing but static at the moment. It looks like 
there's a data tape rhythmically clicking in and out of one of the broken
terminals.
END

USE
As you toggle through the console settings, it appears that a few of the ship’s 
security feeds are still functional. You can barely make out several vaguely 
human shapes in the grainy picture from the solarium. The cargo bay looks like 
it’s crammed to capacity, but the cargo appears relatively untouched. You think 
you see an occupied bed in the medical bay. You get an esoteric error message 
when you try the comm center feed that you think is trying to tell you that the 
comms camera is just gone. You catch a few frames of a single remaining escape 
pod before the video cuts out. Flipping briskly through the remaining feeds 
shows nothing but dead connections. You allow yourself a resigned sigh.
END

SEARCH
You quickly grab the data tape before it's chunked back into the terminal.
Comparing the label to the date on a nearby screen says that it contains 
security footage from two weeks ago, but you're going to have to find a working 
tape player if you want to see it. You put it in your pocket.

There doesn't seem to be anything else here that's worth taking with you.
