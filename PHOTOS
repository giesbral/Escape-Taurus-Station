LOOK_AT
Your crewmates have decorated one of the long, dull bulkheads here with an 
elaborate mosaic of photographs. Family and friends grin and wave in infinite 
repeat from a thousand tiny frames. You recognize some of your crewmates with 
their wives and husbands, children and… what looks like 15 exactly identical 
labrador retrievers in this one. Must be the ship’s geneticist. And here’s a 
photo of you and the rest of the crew laughing and singing in the galley. 
Judging from the smudged icing on the cake, it looks like it must’ve been from 
Hal’s last birthday. You turn away from the pictures as your stomach rumbles 
with thoughts of cake.
