LOOK_AT
The tomato plant has quite a few large red tomatoes hanging off the vines. 
It is in a large planter full of potting soil. This is a curiousity on board 
this station since all of the other plants are grown in an optimized liquid 
nutrient mix. This plant and the soil are just a way to remember 'home.'

TAKE
Ummmm....No. You don't have room in your inventory for a tomato plant. 
Even if you did, why would you take a freakin' tomato plant with you?! Collect 
the necessary pod parts and get off this station!
