LONGFORM
You wake up sitting on the floor, propped up against a stack of 
berths built into the wall. The side of your head throbs. You probe it 
gingerly, wince, and bring your hand away wet with blood. The dull maroon 
smears on the floor tell that you were dragged here, probably by the 
crew member slumped beside you. Giving him a once-over with 
your unswollen eye, you find his name tag. 
"HAL", it says, in serious-minded block print. 
As your cloudy thoughts coalesce, you remember that Hal is the ship's 
security chief, and your crewmate. Rather, was your crewmate; 
Hal has contracted the glassy stare of the dead. 
The series of large puncture wounds thundering across his abdomen bring 
to mind startling after-images of red violence. 
You get up, too quickly, and brace yourself against the bulkhead. 
You take several deep breaths, attempting to quiet the 
staccato pounding in your head. 
When you're ready, you take a slow, sidelong look around the room. 
You find that you're in the ship's crew quarters.
END

SHORTFORM
This is the Crew Quarters, where you woke up. 
As you enter, your gut jumps into your throat. 
You gasp for breath as you choke on a startled scream. 
Right, Hal's body is here. You'd forgotten about him somehow.
