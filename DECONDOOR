LOOK_AT
Forward, you see a pair of hermetically sealed doors to the decon station that
leads to the research labs. A computer screen above a keycard reader next
to the doors says,
	
 SECURITY LOCKDOWN: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN COMMUNICATIONS ARRAY
 EMERGENCY PROCEDURE ‘TERESHKOVA’ CURRENTLY IN EFFECT
 OVERRIDE LEVEL: BASILISK; LOCAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED
 PLEASE SCAN KEYCARD

The machine doesn't appear to be joking. It looks like you'll have to find one
of these keycards everyone is talking about if you want to get into the 
research labs.
END

USE***KEYCARD
You slide the keycard through a slot on the right side of the door and you hear 
a whoosh as the pressure between the two rooms equalize.
END

USE***ACTIVATED
The door is unsealed. Your keycard has unlocked this door.
END

USE
You see the Decontamination Door to the Research Lab. It is sealed for your 
protection. You will need to use a keycard in order to open this door.
