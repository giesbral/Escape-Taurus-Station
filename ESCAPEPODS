LONGFORM
The Escape Pod Bay is home to the station's Emergency Escape Pod evacuation 
system. These pods can withstand rapid atmospheric reentry and can get you to 
the surface safely. There should be enough pods for every member on-board, but
it looks like the only remaining Escape Pod is severely damaged. You'll need 
to find replacements for the broken components if you want to repair the pod
and escape the station. You feel a sudden rush of urgency. Not only is this
place falling apart, but the constant anxiety is starting to make you see
things and jump at shadows. You would really like to get out of here with your
sanity still intact.
