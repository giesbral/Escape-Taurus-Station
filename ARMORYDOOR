LOOK_AT***ACTIVATED
You see the blast door to the ship’s armory. Historically an 
obstacle to be taken seriously, now open for your convenience.
END

LOOK_AT
You see the blast door to the ship’s armory. Apparently, it’s 
made of 8 inches of tungsten steel. There’s a bit of graffiti on the abutting 
bulkhead that says so. “8 INCHES OF TUNGSTEN STEEL”, it says, though you’re 
fairly confident the author is grossly overestimating. Either way, it’s also 
locked, so you aren’t getting in there without the keys.

You notice that whatever key fits this keyhole must be rather fiddly.
END

USE***KEYRING
You try several of the fiddly keys on the keyring. Finally, one especially
fiddly key clicks in the lock and you hear the humming of hydraulics as the 
seals crack on the armored doors. They open slightly with a sudden jolt 
and then slide apart with a smooth motion. As cool air floods the room, your
nose fills with the tangy odors of oil and gunmetal. However, you see nothing,
the lights appear to be off in the armory. 
END

USE***ACTIVATED
The door is already open and is equipped with fail-safes to prevent users from 
crushing themselves or pulling pranks on their friends. The door is very 
businesslike and appears to have little patience for tomfoolery. You leave it
alone for now.
END

USE
This heavy blast door is locked. It has a menacing air about it, as if the
door knows it's business and doesn't really like you. It's the kind of air
you'd expect from a door in charge of guarding an armory filled with 
experimental space weapons. You'll need the key if you want to get inside.
