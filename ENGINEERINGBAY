LONGFORM
The Engineering Bay is home to the stationâ€™s considerable library of repair 
equipment and can store large pieces of machinery while they are being worked 
on. Welding tools, batteries of all shapes and sizes, and hundreds of spare 
parts are all neatly organized and stored here should they be needed at any 
time to repair the station. On a workbench, you see a soldering iron, heaps of
discarded computer components, and spools of transparent aluminum. Near the
seemingly endles rows of storage shelves, there's a large cargo crane that
looks like a bright red robotic arm.
